<div class="css-0"><span style="font-size:0"></span><h2><div><a name="Colorectal-cancer-and-bacterial-infections">Colorectal cancer and bacterial infections</a></div></h2><p>Colorectal cancer occurs in the colon or the rectum. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, it is the third most common type of cancer in the United States. Around <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/risk_factors.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">90%</a> of cases occur in people aged 50 years or older.</p><p>As well as age, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/risk_factors.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">risk factors</a> include a family history of colorectal cancer, some genetic syndromes, obesity, a lack of exercise, a diet low in fruit and vegetables, and inflammatory bowel disease.</p><p>Anaerobic bacteria, unlike aerobic bacteria, do not require oxygen in order to function. They are a normal part of the human body, existing in various locations, including the gut. </p><p>They usually do not cause infections, but when they do, it is most <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482349/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">often</a> in the area that the bacteria inhabit.</p><p>The authors of the new study note that previous research had linked specific types of anaerobic bacteria with colorectal cancer. The researchers wanted to further explore this link through a large-scale study.</p></div>
<div class="css-0"><span style="font-size:0"></span><h2><div><a name="Over-2-million-participants">Over 2 million participants</a></div></h2><p>The study took place in two regions of Denmark between 2007 and 2016. It involved over 2 million participants. </p><p>For the analysis, the team gathered data on 45,760 blood infections, including information about the type of pathogens present in the participants’ bloodstreams.</p><p>The authors then compared this information with data from the Danish Colorectal Cancer Group Database. In particular, they looked for new cases of colorectal cancer, especially those that developed following a blood infection from any of the bacteria already associated with colorectal cancer.</p><p>Of the 45,760 people who had a bacterial blood infection, 492 (1.1%) later developed colorectal cancer. Of these, 241 (0.5%) were within the first year of the bacterial blood infection. </p><p>The researchers matched each of these people by age and sex to a control group of five people who had not had a blood infection.</p></div>
<div class="css-0"><span style="font-size:0"></span><h2><div><a name="Significantly-higher-risk-of-cancer">Significantly higher risk of cancer</a></div></h2><p>The study authors found that anaerobic bacterial blood infections were associated with a significant increase in the risk of colorectal cancer.</p><p>For example, those who had a <em>Clostridium septicum</em> infection were 42 times more likely to develop colorectal cancer within the next year.</p><p><strong>Only 0.5% of the control group, who had not had a bacterial infection, developed colorectal cancer, compared with 20.8% of those who had a <em>C. septicum</em> infection.</strong></p><p>As the study authors conclude in their paper: “In this large scale cohort study, it was found that, in [people] with blood infections caused by selected anaerobic bacteria, the risk of developing colorectal cancer was increased by up to 42 times compared with [people] with blood infections caused by aerobic bacteria such as [<em>Escherichia coli</em>] or [<em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>] or negative controls.”</p><blockquote class="css-34gtoi"><p>“The discovery of blood infections with certain anaerobic bacteria could potentially result in a recommendation of screening for colorectal cancer in selected [individuals].”</p></blockquote><p>Study co-author Dr. Ulrik Justesen, from Odense University Hospital in Denmark, notes that although there was a clear link between anaerobic bacterial infections of the blood and colorectal cancer, it was not clear what the causal relationship was between them.</p><p>In Dr. Justesen’s words: “At this stage, we are not sure if the bacteria are directly causing cases of colorectal cancer, or if the blood infection with these bacteria is itself caused by the cancer. It’s an example of the question ‘Is this the chicken or the egg?’”</p><p>Looking ahead, Dr. Justesen and team want to gain more detail on bacteria in people with cancer. </p><p>He says: “Our follow-up research of this study will focus on the specific bacteria from [people with cancer] to see if we can identify specific characteristics that could be implicated in cancer development. If this is the case, it could be of great importance when it comes to screening and treatment of colorectal cancer.”</p><p><strong>This may mean that screening for colorectal cancer could be more effective. According to Dr. Justesen, “With regards to screening, if we saw these high risk bacteria in combination with advanced age, then it would definitely be worth screening the [person] for colorectal cancer.”</strong></p><p>Although the results are interesting, this research is awaiting presentation at a scientific conference. Therefore, details about the full methodology and results are not yet available. </p><p>The researchers have not yet written a full paper, and the results have not gone through peer review. Because of this, it is not possible to scrutinize the findings in full.</p></div>',

Antibodies are molecules that have learned to recognize and fight the pathogens, such as viruses, that have caused disease.</p><p>Doctors can separate plasma, one of the blood components that contain such antibodies, and administer it to people whose bodies are currently fighting an infectious disease.

Right now, the data [is] being analyzed. We are hopeful,” he also told <em>MNT</em>.</p><p>“And,” he added, “especially since [the] Italians are reporting already that the use of convalescent plasma was associated with a drop in mortality [due to COVID-19]. We are hopeful that similar insights [will] come from the analysis of the data in the United States.”</p><p>In Europe, the European Blood Alliance — a non-profit association — report that <a href="https://europeanbloodalliance.eu/activities/convalescent-plasma-cpp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">20 countries</a> have initiated the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID-19 or are considering it for the near future.

Even though there’s very little precedent about that, you have to always worry that your intervention can do harm. Fortunately, we did not see any of that, so we are now focusing on efficacy.”</p><p>– Dr. Arturo Casadevall</p></blockquote><p>There is also the issue that adding more liquid volume into a person’s vascular system could lead to a risky overload, Dr. Casadevall explained.</p><p>“The concerns when you give plasma [include the fact that] rarely, you can get a transfusion reaction, [and] rarely, you could have a volume overload. What do I mean by that? I mean that […] you’re putting volume into blood, and if it goes in too rapidly, it could [lead to an] overload [of the] cardiac system,” he said.</p><p>“So when we looked at the experience of the first 5,000 [patients], we were very reassured that we did not see any major problems.”</p></div>

Many physicians are trying to move it earlier, that is, when people begin to decompensate,” he added.</p><p>But even where there is a will, getting this treatment to the patients who need it sooner rather than later is not always straightforward. “Some of the problem […] is that it takes time,” Dr. Casadevall explained.</p><p><strong>“Because let’s say the doctor orders plasma and people are getting worse. It sometimes takes a while for the plasma to arrive. Some hospitals have it on site, others have to get it from blood banking centers.”</strong></p><p>Despite these obstacles, the use of convalescent plasma therapy is so attractive to healthcare practitioners because they can access it and use it now.</p><p>Unlike with vaccines, whose development takes time, or experimental medication, which needs to go through <a href="/articles/278779" class="content-link css-29oowu">several different stages</a> of testing before it can obtain formal approval, this approach allows doctors to use what is already there — the blood of those who have recovered from the illness — to treat hospitalized patients.</p><p>“People often get confused [about the difference between convalescent plasma therapy and some vaccines] because they both involve antibodies,” Dr. Casadevall told <em>MNT</em>.</p><p>But while <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01221-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">vaccines</a> also operate on the premise of stimulating a person’s immune system to block or kill the virus, they do not use “ready made” antibodies, and testing them for safety and efficacy could take <a href="/articles/coronavirus-vaccine#when-will-it-be-ready" class="content-link css-29oowu">a year or more</a>.</p><p>“When you get plasma, someone else is giving you the antibodies, and you get them immediately,” Dr. Casadevall explains.</p><p>Going forward, he thinks that doctors could use this therapy alongside other options as they gradually become available.</p><blockquote class="css-34gtoi"><p>“This [therapy] will provide something that is immediately available. I think what you [will] see in the United States [will be its] continuous use. I hope that there will be better options down the line. For example, [I and my colleagues] are trying to make antibodies from convalescent plasma that may become available in a few months. There is also a hope for monoclonal antibodies in the future and various antivirals.”</p><p>– Dr. Arturo Casadevall</p></blockquote><p>“[C]onvalescent plasma provides something that can be used today with standard knowledge and standard procedures […] But we do hope that better options will be available in the future,” he reiterated.</p></div>

Inside a host cell, it makes its own replication machinery.</p><p>RNA viruses have exceptionally high <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">mutations rates</a> because their replications enzymes are prone to errors when making new virus copies. </p><p>Virologist Prof. Jonathan Stoye, a senior group leader at the Francis Crick Institute in London in the United Kingdom, told <em>Medical News Today</em> what makes virus mutations significant. </p><p>“A mutation is a change in a genetic sequence,” he said. “The fact of a mutational change is not of primary importance, but the functional consequences are.”</p><p>If a particular genetic alteration changes the target of a drug or antibody that acts against the virus, those viral particles with the mutation will outgrow the ones that do not have it. </p><p>“A change in a protein to allow virus entry into a cell that carries very low amounts of receptor protein could also provide a growth advantage for the virus,” Prof. Stoye added.</p><p>“However, it should be stressed that only a fraction [of] all mutations will be advantageous; most will be neutral or harmful to the virus and will not persist.”</p><blockquote class="css-34gtoi"><strong></strong><p>“Mutations in viruses clearly do matter, as evidenced by the need to prepare new vaccines against [the] influenza virus every year for the effective prevention of seasonal flu and the need to treat HIV-1 simultaneously with several drugs to [prevent the] emergence of resistant virus.”<br><br> – Prof. Jonathan Stoye</p></blockquote></div>
                            <div class="css-0"><span style="font-size:0"></span><h2><div><a name="Researchers-find-mutations">Researchers find mutations</a></div></h2><p><a href="/articles/scientists-discover-unique-mutation-of-new-coronavirus" class="content-link css-29oowu"><em>MNT</em></a> recently featured a research study by a team from Arizona State University in Tempe. The paper described a mutation that mimics a similar event that occurred during the SARS epidemic in 2003. </p><p>The team studied five nasal swab samples that had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. They found that one of these had a deletion, which means that a part of the viral genome was missing. To be precise, 81 nucleotides in the viral genetic code were gone. </p><p>Previous research indicated that similar mutations lowered the ability of the SARS virus to replicate. </p><p>Another study, this time in the <em><a href="https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02344-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">Journal of Translational Medicine</a></em>, proposed that SARS-CoV-2 had picked up specific mutation patterns in distinct geographical regions. </p><p>The researchers, from the University of Maryland in Baltimore and Italian biotech company Ulisse Biomed in Trieste, analyzed eight recurrent mutations in 220 COVID-19 patient samples. </p><p>They found three of these exclusively in European samples and another three exclusively in samples from North America. </p><p>Another <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.069054v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">study</a>, which has not yet been through the peer review process, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutations have made the virus more transmissible in some cases. </p><p>In the paper, Bette Korber — from the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico — and collaborators describe 13 mutations in the region of the viral genome that encodes the spike protein. </p><p>This protein is crucial for infection, as it helps the virus bind to the host cell. </p><p>The researchers note that one particular mutation, which changes an amino acid in the spike protein, “may have originated either in China or Europe, but [began] to spread rapidly first in Europe, and then in other parts of the world, and which is now the dominant pandemic form in many countries.” </p><p>Prof. Stoye commented that the results of this study are, in some ways, not surprising. </p><p>“Viruses are typically finely tuned to their host species. If they jump species, e.g., from bat to human, a degree of retuning is inevitable both to avoid natural host defenses and for optimum interaction with the cells of the new host,” he said. </p><p>“Random mutations will occur, and the most fit viruses will come to predominate,” he added. “Therefore, it does not seem surprising that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving following its jump to, and spread through, the human population. Clearly, such changes are currently taking place, as evidenced by the apparent spread of the [mutation] observed by Korber [and colleagues].” </p><p>However, Prof. Stoye does not think that it is clear at this point how mutations will drive the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the long term.</p><p>“Fears about SARS-CoV-2 evolution to resist still-to-be-developed vaccines and drugs are not unreasonable,” he explained. “Nevertheless, it is also possible that we will see evolution to a less harmful version of the virus, as may well have occurred following initial human colonization by the so-called seasonal coronaviruses.” </p></div>
                            <div class="css-0"><span style="font-size:0"></span><h2><div><a name="Opinions-remain-divided">Opinions remain divided&nbsp;</a></div></h2><p>Earlier this year, researchers from Peking University in Beijing, China, published a paper in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu"><em>National Science Review</em></a> describing two distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, which they termed “S” and “L.” </p><p>They analyzed 103 virus sequence samples and wrote that around 70% were of the L lineage. </p><p>However, a team at the Center for Virus Research at the University of Glasgow in the U.K. disagreed with the findings and published their critique of the data in the journal <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/6/1/veaa034/5827470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu"><em>Virus Evolution</em></a>. </p><p>“Given the repercussions of these claims and the intense media coverage of these types of articles, we have examined in detail the data presented […] and show that the major conclusions of that paper cannot be substantiated,” the authors write.</p><p>Prof. David Robertson, head of Viral Genomics and Bioinformatics at the Centre for Virus Research, was part of the team. <em>MNT</em> asked his views on the possibility of there being more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2. </p><p>“Until there is some evidence of a change in virus biology, we cannot say that there are new strains of the virus. It’s important to appreciate that mutations are a normal byproduct of virus replication and that most mutations we observe won’t have any impact on virus biology or function,” he said. </p><p>“Some of the reports of, for example, amino acid changes in the spike protein are interesting, but at the moment, these are at best a hypothesis. Their potential impact is currently being tested in a number of labs.” </p><p>Prof. Stoye thinks that it is “more a case of semantics rather than anything else” at the moment. </p><p>“If we have different sequences, we have different strains. Only when we have a greater understanding of the functional consequences of the evolutionary changes observed does it make sense to reclassify the different isolates,” he said. </p><p>“At that point, we can seek to correlate sequence variation with prognostic or therapeutic implications. This may take a number of years.”</p></div>

For SARS-CoV-2, there is no conclusive evidence that this has happened yet.”</p><p>“To show that the virus has genetically changed sufficiently to create a different immune response, we would need to characterize the immune protection and show that it worked for one serotype and not for another,” he continued.</p><p>Prof. Hibberd, who has been <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.066977v2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">researching</a> SARS-CoV-2 mutations, explained that scientists are studying neutralizing antibodies to help them define a serotype for SARS-CoV-2. These antibodies can prevent the virus from infecting a host cell, but they may not be effective against a new strain. </p><blockquote class="css-34gtoi"><strong></strong><p>“Several groups around the world have identified a specific mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, and they are concerned that this mutation might alter this type of binding, but we cannot be sure it does that at the moment. More likely, this mutation will likely affect the virus binding to its receptor […], which might affect transmissibility.” </p><p>– Prof. Martin Hibberd</p></blockquote><p>“We ideally need experimental evidence, [such as a] demonstration of a mutation leading to a functional change in the virus in the first instance, and secondly a demonstration that this change will have an impact in [people with the infection],” Prof. Robertson suggested.</p><p>He pointed to lessons that experts learned during the 2014–2018 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, where several research groups had suggested that a mutation had resulted in the virus becoming more easily passed between people and more deadly.</p><p>Cell culture experiments showed that the mutated virus was able to replicate more rapidly. However, when scientists subsequently studied this in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)30569-2#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">animal models</a>, they found that it did not behave any differently than stains without the mutation. </p><p>Scientists around the world continue to search for answers to the many outstanding questions around SARS-CoV-2. No doubt, we will see more research emerge in the coming months and years that will assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 mutations on the COVID-19 pandemic and the future of this new coronavirus. </p></div>

            'content' => '<p>Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD), as its name suggests, is damage to the liver that the excessive consumption of alcohol causes.</p>
<p>Over time, excessive alcohol consumption can cause inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) of liver tissue, and may eventually lead to liver failure. </p>
<p>According to an analysis of trends published in the World Journal of Hepatology in 2017, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5756720/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">16.5%</a> of all liver transplants between 2002–2015 occurred as a result of ALD, making the disease the third most common reason for transplantation. </p>
<p>ALD is irreversible, and there is currently no treatment except for liver transplant. </p>
<p>Doctors typically advise people to stop drinking alcohol altogether to prevent further damage. This has limited success rates in those with alcohol misuse disorder and even has <a href="/articles/322373" class="content-link css-29oowu">risks in itself</a>.</p>
<p>A team from Massachusetts General Hospital have been working to identify desperately needed treatments for ALD. </p>
<p>In a new study featured in the journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/05/08/1911870117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu"><em>PNAS</em></a>, they describe the molecular basis for the disease and possible new drug targets.</p>
<h2><div><a name="Analyzing-liver-cells"><strong>Analyzing liver cells</strong></a></div></h2>
<p>To better understand what causes the liver damage seen in ALD, the researchers started by analyzing human liver samples taken from a cohort of 51 people with varying degrees of ALD severity. </p>
<p>They looked at the expression of different genes in the samples using a technology called <a href="https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0467-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">RNA sequencing</a>.</p>
<p>They found that the expression of several genes, including one called cGAS, was higher in individuals with more severe disease.</p>
<p>The gene cGAS is part of a known biological pathway that involves the molecule IRF3. Researchers already know that activation of this pathway causes the death of liver cells.</p>
<p>In people with ALD, the cGAS-IRF3 pathway initiates an inflammatory response that damages nearby cells and can eventually cause the liver to fail.</p>
<p>In people with ALD, the cGAS-IRF3 pathway initiates an inflammatory response that damages nearby cells and can eventually cause the liver to fail.</p>
<p>This study confirms the importance of cGAS<em></em>in ALD-related liver damage and shows that the level of cGAS expression in liver tissue has links with the severity of the disease.</p>

<div class="css-0">
<span style="font-size:0"></span><h2><div><a name="Uncovering-the-mechanism"><strong>Uncovering the mechanism</strong></a></div></h2>
<p>Scientists know that the cGAS-IRF3 pathway is important in ALD but have been unsure about how alcohol activates the IRF3 molecule, and what causes inflammation to spread throughout the liver.</p><p>Understanding this process is critical because the propagation of the inflammatory signal can continue to damage the liver, even when the person has stopped drinking alcohol.</p><p>To investigate this in more detail, the researchers turned to animal models. They fed mice the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30025151/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-29oowu">Lieber-DeCarli diet,</a> which is an established model of chronic alcohol abuse in rodents. They found that the mice had increased levels of both cGAS and IRF3 in their liver tissue.</p><p>If excess alcohol causes an increase in the expression of these molecules, can removing them protect against alcohol-induced damage?</p><p>To test this, the team genetically engineered mice to remove the cGAS protein. When exposed to alcohol, these mice had both less IRF3 activation and less damage to their liver.</p><p>This showed that cGAS is critical to the ALD disease process and, therefore, a potential drug target.</p><p>The team also found another possible target called Cx32, which they showed to be important in IRF3 activation and the death of liver cells. </p><p>Mice without the gene for coding Cx32 had significantly less liver damage after consuming excess alcohol. The scientists also saw beneficial effects when they inhibited the molecule.</p></div>

This is a big step forward in scientific terms. </p><p>“Until now, we had only a few clues about why alcohol-related liver disease progresses the way it does, but this research fills in key pieces of the puzzle,” explains Dr. Suraj J. Patel, senior author and research fellow in the Department of Medicine at Massachusetts General. </p><p>The discovery of Cx32 as a key regulator of this process makes it an evidence-based target for drug development.
